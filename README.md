# Compiler Design Lab Programs

---

## Cycle I

1. **Write a program to find ε-closure of all states of any given NFA with ε transition.**
2. **Write a program to convert NFA with ε transition to NFA without ε transition.**
3. **Write a program to convert NFA to DFA.**
4. **Write a program to minimize any given DFA.**

## Cycle II

1. **Design and implement a lexical analyzer for a given language using C. The lexical analyzer should ignore redundant spaces, tabs, and newlines.**
2. **Write a Lex program to recognize all strings which do not contain the first four characters of your name as a substring.**
3. **Write a YACC program to recognize a valid variable that starts with a letter followed by any number of letters or digits.**
4. **Implementation of a calculator using Lex and YACC.**
5. **Convert the BNF rules into YACC form and write code to generate an abstract syntax tree.**
6. **Write a YACC program to check the syntax of a `for` statement in C.**

## Cycle III

1. **Develop an operator precedence parser for a given language.**
2. **Write a program to simulate First and Follow of any given grammar.**
3. **Construct a recursive descent parser for an expression.**
4. **Construct a Shift-Reduce parser for a given language.**

## Cycle IV

1. **Implement Intermediate code generation for simple expressions.**
